# Getting Started

The FacialRecognitionApp is a frontend for the [FacialRecognitionApp-API](https://github.com/ChrisKCarr/FacialRecognitionApp-API), built with React. Get a response from the Clarifai API and see it visualize. More on Clarifai's `face-detection` model can be found [here](https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection).
